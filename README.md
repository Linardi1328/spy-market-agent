# Risk-Controlled SPY Market Intelligence and Paper-Trading System

`spy-market-agent` is an educational Python 3.12 project for researching SPY daily
signals, evaluating leakage-aware machine-learning baselines, running risk-controlled
long-or-cash backtests, persisting audit artifacts in SQLite, and preparing explicitly
approved Alpaca paper orders behind fail-closed safety gates.

It is experimental research software. It is not investment advice, does not claim
profitability, and is not real-money trading infrastructure.

`v2.0.0-alpha.2`. Version 2 Phase 3 uses package version `2.0.0a3` and release identifier
`v2.0.0-alpha.3`. Version 2 Phase 4 starts from package version `2.0.0a3` and targets the
future public identifier `v2.0.0-beta.1`; no beta tag exists yet. Release tags must point
only to successfully verified `main` commits after review approval and merge.

## Version 1 Historical Baseline

Version 1.0.0 covers the completed Phase 1 through Phase 8 implementation plus the Phase 9
documentation and release-readiness work. It remains the frozen historical baseline:

- SPY ETF only.
- Daily OHLCV data only.
- Long-or-cash positions only.
- No short selling, leverage, margin, fractional-share orders, or additional markets.
- Provider-independent market-data contracts and validation, but no market-data downloader
  in Version 1.0.0.
- Leakage-safe trailing features and the approved open `t + 1` to open `t + 6` label.
- Chronological train, validation, and final-test design with gap-aware split contracts.
- Deterministic logistic-regression and gradient-boosting baselines.
- Validation-only model selection and locked final-test evaluation.
- Fixed long-or-cash signal policy and next-open execution mapping.
- Independent risk checks before every backtest fill.
- In-memory backtesting with transaction costs, slippage, cash, shares, equity, drawdown,
  turnover, fills, orders, and risk-decision audit frames.
- Explicit SQLite initialization and persistence for validated research artifacts.
- Read-only FastAPI routes for persisted data status, model evaluations, backtests, and
  local paper-execution status.
- Read-only Streamlit dashboard views backed by the FastAPI client.
- Explicitly invoked Alpaca paper-only execution service for SPY whole-share market DAY
  orders, with no API or dashboard submission controls.

## Version 2 Phase 1 Alpha

Version 2 Phase 1 adds an accepted historical SPY daily-data foundation. It uses package
version `2.0.0a1` and release identifier `v2.0.0-alpha.1`. The release tag must point only
to a successfully verified `main` commit.

Phase 1 provides:

- Explicit user-triggered SPY historical-data acquisition.
- An Alpaca Market Data API provider adapter.
- Separate market-data credentials.
- Sanitized raw JSON snapshots.
- Canonical validated CSV bars.
- Deterministic manifests, SHA-256 checksums, and dataset identity.
- XNYS session validation and OHLCV validation.
- Deep offline dataset verification.
- Safe local ignored provider-data storage under `data/raw/`, `data/canonical/`, and
  `data/manifests/`.

Example explicit acquisition command:

```bash
python -m spy_market_agent.market_data.cli acquire \
  --provider alpaca \
  --symbol SPY \
  --start 2016-01-04 \
  --end 2016-01-08 \
  --timeframe 1Day \
  --feed sip \
  --adjustment all \
  --data-root ./data \
  --acknowledge-provider-terms
```

Credentials are optional for normal tests. Real Alpaca market-data acquisition requires
`ALPACA_MARKET_DATA_API_KEY` and `ALPACA_MARKET_DATA_SECRET_KEY`; these are separate from
paper-trading credentials and are read only from the environment. Downloaded provider data is
local and ignored under `data/raw/`, `data/canonical/`, and `data/manifests/`.

Phase 1 does not train models, run benchmarks, test prediction accuracy, claim profitability,
submit orders, add real-time operation, or enable live trading.

## Version 2 Phase 2 Alpha Release

Version 2 Phase 2 adds accepted real historical benchmark infrastructure and owner-run
acceptance evidence for the existing approved SPY research workflow. It uses a verified
Alpaca SIP, `1Day`, adjustment `all` SPY dataset from 2018-01-02 through 2025-12-31. The
owner-run benchmark used dataset ID `spy-v2p1-825930b0a2bcab20c733b867` and benchmark ID
`spy-v2p2-a065593e952e6a9d96f4be86`; generated provider data and benchmark artifacts remain
ignored and are not distributed with the repository.

Engineering result:

- Implementation PR #20 was merged at main commit `1155c3c`.
- Dataset verification, benchmark verification, and runtime-lineage verification passed in
  the owner environment.
- Validation, final-test locking, one controlled final-test execution, completion evidence,
  and audit verification completed.
- Owner-run quality gates passed: 999 tests, 85% coverage, Ruff, formatting, MyPy, and clean
  working tree.

Scientific result:

- `logistic_regression` was selected over `gradient_boosting` by higher validation ROC AUC.
- Final-test ROC AUC was `0.4640772128060263`, below `0.5`.
- Final-test log loss and Brier score did not beat the training-prevalence baseline.
- The selected model predicted positive on about `97.6%` of final-test rows, behaving close
  to an almost-always-long signal during that period.

This is valid benchmark evidence and not an engineering failure. It does not establish a
reliable predictive edge, trading readiness, profitability, or investment suitability.

## Version 2 Phase 3 Alpha 3 Release

Version 2 Phase 3 is complete and released as `v2.0.0-alpha.3` for the Walk-Forward Model
Research phase. PR #24 merged the approved framework and initial research scaffolding. PR
#25 merged the manual, offline, classification-first development research runner, owner
development testing completed locally, and Alpha 3 release preparation was merged and
tagged. The governing document remains
[Version 2 Phase 3 Walk-Forward Model Research Specification](docs/V2_PHASE_03_WALK_FORWARD_RESEARCH_SPEC.md).
Sanitized Alpha 3 acceptance evidence is recorded in
[Version 2 Phase 3 Alpha 3 Release Evidence](docs/V2_PHASE_03_ALPHA3_RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md).

The `spy_market_agent.research` package now provides a manual, offline, classification-first
development runner for verified local Phase 1 SPY manifests. It verifies lineage before
loading canonical data, builds research-only OHLCV feature families, applies the shared
60-session campaign warm-up, reconstructs the frozen Phase 2 final-test prediction-session
boundary, truncates the eligible development source slice before Version 1 labels are built,
constructs deterministic expanding-window folds, reruns fixed Phase 2 model baselines,
evaluates finite predeclared scikit-learn candidate grids, runs the predeclared calibration
sub-study, records regime and drift diagnostics, and writes ignored research artifacts under
`artifacts/research/<experiment_id>/`.

Phase 3 does not tune against the already-opened Phase 2 final test and does not reconstruct
Phase 2 final-test row-level labels for development research. The Phase 2 result may be
cited only as frozen summary baseline evidence. The owner-run development campaign produced
`NO CANDIDATE PROMOTION`; this is valid Phase 3 evidence and does not authorize protected
evaluation, paper research, shadow mode, or live trading. This branch does not authorize
protected evaluation, strategy-threshold optimization, strategy candidate selection, live
trading, production paper execution, shadow mode, API write routes, dashboard execution
controls, schedulers, automatic order submission, or broker communication. Package/runtime
version remains `2.0.0a3`.

Owner-run development research, when authorized locally, is launched manually with:

```bash
python -m spy_market_agent.research.cli run-development \
  --manifest data/manifests/alpaca/SPY/1Day/sip/all/DATASET_ID.manifest.json \
  --data-root ./data \
  --campaign-config configs/research/phase3_development_campaign.json
```

## Version 2 Phase 4 Shadow-Mode Specification

Version 2 Phase 4 is active only for specification and infrastructure-first Real-Time
Shadow Mode scaffolding. The governing document is
[Version 2 Phase 4 Real-Time Shadow Mode Specification](docs/V2_PHASE_04_REAL_TIME_SHADOW_MODE_SPEC.md).
The target future release is `v2.0.0-beta.1`, but the package/runtime version remains
`2.0.0a3` and no beta tag exists.

Phase 4 has two gates. Gate A infrastructure entry is permitted for shadow architecture,
freshness and completeness policy, XNYS daily-session scheduling functions, idempotent
shadow run identities, monitoring state, alert concepts, and model-admission locks. Gate B
model-connected shadow inference is not satisfied because Phase 3 promoted no model. The
current state is `NO APPROVED SHADOW MODEL`, and `model_connected` shadow inference must
raise `blocked_no_approved_model` unless a future separately approved model-admission record
exists.

The initial `spy_market_agent.shadow` package supports `observation_only_no_model` mode.
This mode can inspect synthetic or local session readiness, compute deterministic run
identity, and report why inference is unavailable. It cannot generate predictions,
model-based `LONG` or `CASH` proposals from real market data, broker orders, paper orders,
risk approvals, or execution requests. Phase 4 does not add intraday data, a scheduler,
strategy optimization, protected evaluation, Phase 5 production paper operation, live
trading, broker communication, API write routes, or dashboard execution controls.

## Safety Boundaries

Live trading is not supported. `EXECUTION_MODE` may only be `paper`, and any attempt to
configure `live` must fail. The committed defaults cannot submit an order:

- no live trading
- no automatic paper-order submission
- `ENABLE_PAPER_EXECUTION=false`
- `DRY_RUN=true`
- `PAPER_EXECUTION_KILL_SWITCH=true`
- the durable SQLite paper-execution kill switch defaults to engaged

Paper execution requires all of the following through an explicit service call, not through
application startup, FastAPI, or Streamlit:

- paper mode, paper execution enabled, dry-run disabled, and configuration kill switch off
- durable SQLite kill switch off with explicit confirmation and audit reason
- Alpaca paper credentials supplied through runtime configuration
- canonical Alpaca paper endpoint identity: `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets`
- `TradingClient(..., paper=True)` constructed only when the adapter is explicitly created
- a risk-approved immutable `ProposedOrder`
- a deterministic `PaperOrderInstruction` fingerprint
- a human `PaperOrderApproval` bound to the exact signal ID, client-order ID, and fingerprint
- execution-time risk re-evaluation
- regular market hours on the instruction execution session
- no stale or expired signal
- unique signal ID, client-order ID, and approval ID
- at most one SPY paper-execution reservation per execution session

Timeouts, transport uncertainty, contradictory broker responses, and broker acceptance
followed by local ledger failure are recorded as `submission_unknown`. The system does not
retry automatically. Reconciliation is lookup-only by `client_order_id` and never submits a
new order.

## Not Implemented

The current implemented system intentionally does not include:

- real-time data feeds
- investment recommendations
- profitability claims
- production probability calibration or strategy-threshold optimization
- unrestricted hyperparameter tuning or model binary persistence
- API write routes
- dashboard execution controls
- automatic broker communication
- automatic paper-order submission
- order cancellation, replacement, liquidation, stops, limits, brackets, OCO, or OTO
- schedulers, workers, cron jobs, deployment files, or cloud infrastructure
- live trading or live Alpaca endpoints
- assets other than SPY

Version 2 Phase 2 includes completed historical benchmarking on one owner-run real SPY SIP
dataset. It does not include model research beyond the approved locked candidates and does
not prove predictive market edge.

Version 2 Phase 3 is released as `v2.0.0-alpha.3`. The completed development campaign
produced `NO CANDIDATE PROMOTION`; it did not run protected evaluation, strategy
optimization, shadow inference, or paper/live operation.

Version 2 Phase 4 currently includes only specification and infrastructure-first shadow
scaffolding. Model-connected shadow inference remains locked because no approved shadow
model exists.

Version 1.0.0 specifically did not include market-data downloading; the explicit SPY
historical-data acquisition CLI begins in Version 2 Phase 1.

## Quick Start — Open the Local Dashboard

This workflow launches the application locally in your browser. It is not a public internet
deployment. No Alpaca credentials are required for the safe dashboard demo. The API and
dashboard are read-only, no order is submitted, and an empty dashboard is expected until
research artifacts are persisted.

### 1. Clone and Enter the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linardi1328/spy-market-agent.git
cd spy-market-agent

pwd
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
test -f pyproject.toml && echo "Repository root confirmed"
```

Editable installation fails with errors such as `neither setup.py nor pyproject.toml found`
when these commands are run from your home directory or another folder.

### 2. Create and Activate a Python 3.12 Environment

macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

python --version
python -c "import spy_market_agent; print(spy_market_agent.__version__)"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

python --version
python -c "import spy_market_agent; print(spy_market_agent.__version__)"
```

The import command is the source of truth for the package version on your branch.

### 3. Initialize the Local Database Explicitly

```bash
python -c "from spy_market_agent.persistence import initialize_database; initialize_database('./spy_market_agent.sqlite3')"
test -f spy_market_agent.sqlite3 && echo "Database initialized"
```

Initialization does not download data, train a model, contact Alpaca, or submit an order.
The database file is local and ignored by Git.

### 4. Start FastAPI in Terminal A

Open a new terminal window or tab. Keep this command running. Do not type the Streamlit
command into the same active terminal.

```bash
cd /path/to/spy-market-agent
source .venv/bin/activate

SQLITE_DATABASE_PATH=./spy_market_agent.sqlite3 \
python -m uvicorn "spy_market_agent.api.main:create_app" \
  --factory \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8000
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\spy-market-agent
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

$env:SQLITE_DATABASE_PATH="./spy_market_agent.sqlite3"
python -m uvicorn "spy_market_agent.api.main:create_app" `
  --factory `
  --host 127.0.0.1 `
  --port 8000
```

The FastAPI terminal must remain open.

### 5. Verify FastAPI Before Starting Streamlit

In another terminal, run:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

The response should contain `"status":"ok"`. You can also open
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` in a browser. Do not continue until the health check works.

### 6. Start Streamlit in Terminal B

Use another terminal window or tab; this is a separate terminal from Terminal A:

```bash
cd /path/to/spy-market-agent
source .venv/bin/activate

DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
streamlit run src/spy_market_agent/dashboard/streamlit_app.py \
  --server.address 127.0.0.1 \
  --server.port 8501 \
  --server.headless true \
  --browser.gatherUsageStats false
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\spy-market-agent
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

$env:DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
streamlit run src/spy_market_agent/dashboard/streamlit_app.py `
  --server.address 127.0.0.1 `
  --server.port 8501 `
  --server.headless true `
  --browser.gatherUsageStats false
```

Headless mode avoids Streamlit's first-run email prompt.

### 7. Open the Application

- Dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:8501`
- API health: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`
- FastAPI interactive documentation: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

These addresses work only while their corresponding terminal processes remain running.

### 8. Expected First-Run Behavior

A newly initialized database may correctly show no persisted market-data status, no model
runs, no backtests, no paper-order attempts, paper execution disabled, dry-run enabled, kill
switches engaged, and Alpaca credential presence false.

This proves the interface and API are running. It does not prove that a model benchmark has
been executed.

### 9. Stop and Clean Up

Stop each server with `Ctrl+C` in its own terminal. Optional cleanup:

```bash
deactivate 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf .venv
rm -f spy_market_agent.sqlite3
git status --short
```

Do not delete ignored Phase 1 market-data files or benchmark artifacts unless you
intentionally created them and no longer need them.

### 10. Troubleshooting

Error: `neither setup.py nor pyproject.toml found`

Cause: the command was run outside the repository root.

Fix:

```bash
cd spy-market-agent
test -f pyproject.toml && echo "Repository root confirmed"
```

Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: spy_market_agent`

Fix:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Error: dashboard says API unavailable

Fix: confirm the FastAPI terminal is still running, open
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`, confirm `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL`, and confirm ports `8000`
and `8501` are not occupied.

Error: database unavailable

Fix: initialize `spy_market_agent.sqlite3` and ensure `SQLITE_DATABASE_PATH` points to the
same file used during initialization.

Error: port already in use

Fix: stop the process using the port or choose local alternatives, for example FastAPI
`--port 8001` and Streamlit `--server.port 8502`. If FastAPI uses a different port, set
`DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL` to match it.

Error: dashboard opens but contains no results

Fix: the database is empty. Research artifacts must be generated and persisted through
approved workflows before model runs or backtests appear.

## Read-Only API Routes

The FastAPI application exposes only GET routes:

```text
GET /health
GET /api/v1/data/status
GET /api/v1/model-runs
GET /api/v1/model-runs/{run_id}
GET /api/v1/model-runs/{run_id}/predictions
GET /api/v1/backtests
GET /api/v1/backtests/{run_id}
GET /api/v1/backtests/{run_id}/equity
GET /api/v1/backtests/{run_id}/orders
GET /api/v1/backtests/{run_id}/risk-decisions
GET /api/v1/backtests/{run_id}/fills
GET /api/v1/paper-trading/status
GET /api/v1/paper-orders
GET /api/v1/paper-orders/{client_order_id}
```

The API and dashboard never approve orders, submit orders, reconcile orders, change kill
switches, cancel orders, replace orders, or construct an Alpaca client.

## Quality Policy

The repository uses:

- Pytest with branch coverage enabled.
- Required full-suite coverage gate: `pytest --cov-fail-under=85`.
- Ruff linting: `ruff check .`.
- Ruff formatting check: `ruff format --check .`.
- MyPy strict checks over `src` and `tests`: `mypy src tests`.
- Warning policy: unexpected warnings fail by default. The only allowed warning filters are
  exact documented upstream dependency warnings in `pyproject.toml`.

The current deterministic tests use synthetic or in-memory data. No committed real SPY
dataset, generated SQLite database, private screenshot, account identifier, or credential is
required.
