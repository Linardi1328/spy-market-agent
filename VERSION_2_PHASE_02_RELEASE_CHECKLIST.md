## Post-Merge Steps

These unchecked items are an operator procedure for creating the release tag after branch
approval. They are not claims that the post-merge actions have already been performed.

- [ ] Merge approved branch into `main`.
- [ ] Pull merged `main`.
- [ ] Run full verification again on `main`.
- [ ] Confirm package/runtime versions.
- [ ] Confirm clean working tree.
- [ ] Create annotated `v2.0.0-alpha.2` tag.
- [ ] Push the tag.
- [ ] Confirm the tag points to verified `main`.
- [ ] Begin Phase 3 only after tag confirmation and a separate approved Phase 3
  specification.

Post-merge items are intentionally unchecked on this review branch.
